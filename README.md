# Electron Charge‑to‑Mass Ratio (e/m) via the Helical Method

A laboratory project that uses the helical method to measure the charge‑to‑mass ratio of the electron. Data collection was performed using a magnetic field apparatus and electron beam tube; all data analysis and visualization were carried out in R.

## Background

The helical method measures the ratio $e/m$ by observing electrons moving in a uniform magnetic field. Electrons describe a helical trajectory whose pitch and radius depend on their velocity and the magnetic field strength. By measuring these geometrical parameters and knowing the applied accelerating voltage and magnetic flux density, the charge‑to‑mass ratio can be calculated from:

$$
\frac{e}{m} = \frac{2V}{B^2\,r^2}
$$

where  
- $V$ is the accelerating potential,  
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength,  
- $r$ is the helix radius.
